# Flask Web Chat App
My graduation project based on Python (Flask) for backend and HTML/CSS for frontend. It's not optimized for various screen sizes because main focus was on backend but on computer it should be enough. Code is written to work with Heroku and with small modifications it can work with other Cloud platforms.
